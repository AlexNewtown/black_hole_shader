/*<h2>black_hole/definitions.glsl</h2>

<p>This file defines the types which are used in the main
<a href="functions.glsl.html">functions</a> of our
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08735">black hole model</a>. A 
<a href="preprocess/definitions.h.html">C++ equivalent</a> of this file allows
the same functions to be compiled by a C++ compiler (in order to unit test our
<a href="preprocess/functions.h.html">preprocessing functions</a>).

<p>To increase the code readability we introduce different "types" for
dimensionless quantities and for angles, as well as for the two precomputed
textures of our model:
*/

// The types used in the main functions of our black hole shader. C++ equivalent
// of these types are used to compile these functions with a C++ compiler, both
// to reuse them in order to precompute the textures they need, and for testing
// them.

// Angles and dimensionless quantities.
#define Angle float
#define Real float

// An angle and a time (in the 1st and 2nd components, respectively).
#define TimedAngle vec2

// An inverse distance and a time (in the 1st and 2nd components, respectively).
#define TimedInverseDistance vec2

// A 2D texture with TimedAngle values.
#define RayDeflectionTexture sampler2D

// A 2D texture with TimedInverseDistance values.
#define RayInverseRadiusTexture sampler2D
